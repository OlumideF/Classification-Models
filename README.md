# Classification-Models

The classification algorithms were written in Colab

The first sets of codes were used to authenticated API to access the dataset in a google drive

The machine learning code was used to import dataset, explore the data, build models, examine the model performance, deploy the best model, and make an inference with the model. The code was written in Python using NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn libraries. Classification models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbor, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Extreme Gradient Boosting, Decision Tree and Support Vector Machine were developed. Furthermore, the code shows the accuracy of each model built, and the model with the best performance (Random Forest) was used to predict a seed variety.
